# Blank Line Organizer

This extension will help you organize blank lines in the code by removing multiple blank lines. The extension removes blank lines only from the selected lines if any, otherwise from the entire file.

## Demo

![Demo](./demo/demo.gif)

## Usage

Press `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + B`

or

Enter `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P` search for `> Remove blank lines`

or

Set triggerOnSave to true and save the file

## Configuration

| Configuration                   | Type      | Default Value | Description
| ------------------------------- | --------- | ------------- | -----------------------------
| blankLine.keepOneEmptyLine      | `boolean` | `true`        | Set to false to remove all blank lines or true to keep one.
| blankLine.triggerOnSave         | `boolean` | `true`        | If set to true, the command will be triggered on save.
| blankLine.insertLineAfterBlock  | `boolean` | `true`        | If set to true inserts a blank line after block statement (unless the next line is also closing a block).
| blankLine.allowElseAfterBlock   | `boolean` | `true`        | If set to true won't insert a blank line after block statement if next line is an else.
| blankLine.formatIfElseBlock     | `string`  | `1tbs`        | Defines if and how to format if-else blocks. More information and examples [here](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/brace-style.html).
| blankLine.removeBlockPadding    | `boolean` | `true`        | If set to true removes all blank lines after opening and before closing a block statement.
| blankLine.languageIds           | `string[]`| `["javascript", "typescript", "json", "css", "scss"]` | Trigger this command on save, only if current language-id is in the list

NOTE: By default the extension is configured to format on save, you can disable this by setting `blankLine.triggerOnSave` to `false`.
